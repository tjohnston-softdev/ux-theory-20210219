# UX Theory Question (19 February 2021)

At the beginning of an internship that took place from February to April 2021, I was required to take an online exam to assess my technical skills in various areas related to IT. One of the questions was to review a wireframe mock-up for a mobile app interface design and give a series of answers on how it can be improved in relation to the user story.

The exam took most of the day and was timed on a per-question basis so there was no way I could have save and archive every single question. Out of the questions that I was able to save, this was the only one worth sharing publicly.

I took the exam on 19 February 2021. I had just enough spare time on the question to save it locally. After the test was finished that day, I did a rough markdown conversion. I used it as a basis for the public release with very minor formatting changes. The question was uploaded to GitHub and shared publicly on 7 November 2021.
